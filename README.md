In this project the main function is runStopwatch() ,  It is responsible for updating the time values (hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds) and displaying them on the HTML page in a formatted manner.

if,elseif and else conditions are used,
like if the miliseconds count is 100 then seconds will increased by 1 and reset the count,
elseif seconds is 60 then minutes is increase by 1 and reset the seconds,
elseif minute is 60 then hour is increase by 1 and reset the minutes and seconds at 0.

In summary, runStopwatch() continuously updates and formats the time values, ensuring the accurate representation of elapsed time on the HTML page while the stopwatch is running. The use of setTimeout provides a smooth and continuous update mechanism.
